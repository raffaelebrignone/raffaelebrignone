Hi, I'm Raffaele.

I'm an italian software engineer who's been living in London since 2014.
I've mainly worked as a game developer so far, but I would love to expand my knowledge about lowe levent, fast and efficient coding.
My favourite programming language (and so far the one I used the most) is C++.
Other than that, I'm exploring Python since it seems to be a pretty common language and a good tool to have under the belt.

If you want to reach me to suggest what I could pick up next to expand my knowledge or if I could be of any help, please don't hesitate 
to drop an email at brignone.raffaele@gmail.com
